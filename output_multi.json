      "The United Nations says Gaza is at risk of famine if the war between Israel and Hamas continues.",
      "A quarter of households - roughly 500,000 people - are facing catastrophic conditions, a UN food security agency found. ",
      "It says the territory's entire population of roughly 2.2m people is suffering acute food shortages.",
      "No-one in Gaza is safe from starvation, said Cindy McCain from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).",
      "Humanitarian access is needed now for supplies to flow into and throughout Gaza and for civilians to safely receive life-saving aid. ",
      "The report was published on Thursday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN body that assesses food security in places affected by conflict or natural disaster.",
      "It states that the quantities of commodities, including food, allowed to enter the Gaza Strip are largely insufficient.",
      "Trucks have been bringing aid into Gaza from Egypt for weeks but the WFP recently estimated that just 10% of the food needed is currently getting into the territory. On Wednesday a convoy carrying aid from Jordan crossed into Gaza via Israel for the first time since the start of the war.",
      "The UN Security Council is meanwhile trying to agree on a vote calling for more aid to get into Gaza. The vote has been delayed for several days over the wording of the text. ",
      "The US has expressed support for the latest draft resolution after earlier voicing widespread concerns with an earlier version that called for a ceasefire - something the US is against, saying it would only benefit Hamas. ",
      "The new draft aims to create a mechanism to accelerate aid but makes clear it would involve relevant parties such as Israel. ",
      "It also calls for all available routes to be used for deliveries but does not seek an immediate end to the fighting. ",
      "Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US Ambassador to the UN, described it as a very strong resolution that is fully supported by the Arab group.",
      "Meanwhile, the fighting in and around Gaza continues. Hamas authorities on Thursday accused Israel of attacking the Rafah crossing - killing four people, including the director of the recently reopened Kerem Shalom crossing. Israel's military has not commented on the reported incident. ",
      "Talks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.",
      "But on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.",
      "It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas, saying it aims to destroy the group.",
      "More than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.",
      "Earlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000.",

    "contents": [
      "Chinese authorities are investigating a hospital over an incident where a surgeon allegedly punched the patient he was operating on at the time.",
      "It was captured in a clip that went viral on Chinese social media this week, sparking outrage online.",
      "The hospital's parent group, Aier China, has suspended the surgeon and dismissed the CEO of the hospital where the incident took place in 2019.",
      "The BBC has contacted Aier China for comment.",
      "The video appears to show the surgeon punching a patient in the head at least three times while operating on their eyes.",
      "Aier China, which operates a chain of eye hospitals, said the incident took place during an operation in its hospital in Guigang, a southwestern Chinese city.",
      "The patient was an 82-year-old woman and during the surgery, due to local anaesthesia, the patient had intolerance. She moved her head and eyeballs multiple times, according to their statement.",
      "As the patient could only speak a local dialect and did not appear to respond to the doctor's warnings in Mandarin, the surgeon treated the patient roughly in an emergency situation. Local authorities say the patient sustained bruises on her forehead. ",
      "After the surgery, the hospital's management apologised and paid 500 yuan ($70, Â£55) as compensation, according to the patient's son who spoke to local media outlets. He also said his mother is now blind in her left eye, though it is not clear whether it was due to the incident.",
      "Aier China said the hospital failed to report the incident to headquarters. On Thursday it announced the dismissal of the Guiyang hospital CEO and the suspension of the surgeon - who is also the hospital dean - over serious violations of the group's regulations, which included other unspecified offences.",
      "Though the incident took place in December 2019, it only came to the public's attention this week after a prominent Chinese doctor, Ai Fen, shared CCTV footage of the surgery.",
      "Dr Ai, who was among a group of doctors who alerted the public to the initial Wuhan Covid outbreak, had posted the clip on her Weibo account where she has more than two million followers.",
      "Dr Ai has been embroiled in legal disputes with Aier China since 2021 when she went for an operation at one of their hospitals . She has claimed she nearly became blind in one eye due to that operation, but Aier China has denied the allegation.",

      "The King, wearing the golden Coronation robes over his suit and tie, also dissolves into giggles.",

    "title": "Japan to send Patriot missiles to US which may aid Ukraine",
    "contents": [
      "Japan says it will send Patriot air defence missiles to the US after changing its arms export rules, in a significant shift away from its pacifist policies. ",
      "The move could free up the US to send its own stockpile to Ukraine.",
      "Western powers have been running out of ammunition to supply Ukraine in its defence against Russia's invasion. ",
      "Patriot missiles are among the most advanced weapons supplied by the US to Ukraine.",
      "Tokyo previously only allowed for components of licensed equipment to be sent from Japan to the nation where the manufacturing licence originated. But under the new rules it can ship finished goods too.",
      "Shortly after the government announced this change on Friday, the foreign ministry said it would ship Patriot missiles to the US to further strengthen the Japan-US alliance.",
      "It added that the missiles could only be sent to the US, and would require Japan's approval to be sent to a third country. Japan still bans the export of weapons to countries at war.",
      "This could mean that Japan-made Patriot missiles may replenish the US' stockpile, while Washington sends US-made ones to Ukraine.",
      "In Japan, the Patriot missiles are manufactured by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries under licence from US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and RTX.",
      "It comes after the US government reportedly requested Japan to change its defence export rules. It is the first time Tokyo has done so since 2014.",
      "Earlier this month, the US Congress failed to approve a $60bn aid package for Ukraine despite a plea from President Volodymyr Zelensky.",
      "Ukraine has warned that it is already being forced to downsize some military operations because of a drop-off in foreign aid. It has been asking the US for more air defence support for months. ",
      "Tokyo is also considering exporting 155mm artillery shells to the UK as it makes them under licence from London-based BAE Systems, according to the Financial Times.",
      "Japan's National Security Council is expected to decide what equipment to provide to which country on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The change in rules happens as Japan wrangles with its long-standing pacifist stance.",
      "After World War Two, Japan adopted a constitution which prohibits the country from going to war except in cases of self-defence. The constitution does not officially recognise the military and limits it to self-defence capabilities.",
      "It also imposed an arms export ban, which was in 2014 eased for the first time in almost 50 years under then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe - a move that was viewed with suspicion in China. ",
      "Last year, Japan announced that it would double its military spending to 2% of the country's GDP by 2027, citing threats posed by China and North Korea. ",
      "Beijing's increasing military aggression has fuelled Japanese anxiety that should conflict break out in Taiwan, Japan would not only be pulled into a war between the US and China, but also targeted as a US ally. It hosts US military bases and has the biggest concentration of troops outside America.",
      "North Korea also poses a perennial existential threat to Tokyo, as its nuclear ambitions have grown more alarming - with a record number of missile launches this year, including several that have flown over Japan. ",
